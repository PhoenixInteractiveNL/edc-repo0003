Changes - 12th February 2007
----------------------------

0.06: (Core)
      Experimented with an alternate memory access method, which didn't help performance much
      Halved timeslice sizes
      Move CLUT to be a memory region rather than part of the chip
      Compute buffer size and pixel aspect ratio accurately in the OP, pass to window system
      Cleaned up CPU and RISC interrupt systems, added CPU stop object interrupt
	  Rewrote Tom PIT to the correct spec (and fixed the stall bug I found in it too)
	  Rewrote Jerry PIT to correct an awful inaccuracy. However, to get AvP sound right
            I had to add a hack to multiply the rate by 4. I don't understand why, I don't
            know where the bug is, and in particular I don't know if I should apply the same
            hack to the Tom PIT as well.
	  Fixed a bug that was causing writes to the start of some memory regions to be misdirected
      Rewrote OP towards optional line-granularity
	  Added option to disable DSP altogether
	  Added all DSP wavetables, or at least guesses at same
	  Hacked around a problem that was causing the 'superzapper recharge' sample not to appear in T2K. Also
	        hacked the 'gappy sample' issue by slowing the music replay rate down 2% in the native
	        sound routine
      GPU/Risc fixes: truly embarassing bug with sat8, equally rubbish bug with move pc,
            MMULT instruction, kick off small timeslice on all RISC starts to avoid race if the RISC
            sets a status flag which the 68k then checks, possibly the largest bug in the history
            of errors in RISC interrupts (which weren't saving flags), ADDQMOD instruction,
            PACKUNPACK instruction, PC register, hidata register
	  OP bugfixes: don't infinite loop on zero vscale, abort if hit address zero, fully
	        clipped objects off left side fix, some colour transparency, RGB16 conversion
	        was incorrect, scaled objects needed signed height, 8-bit OP scaled objects,
	        improved horizontal scaling accuracy, added RGB24 mode
	  Blitter bugfixes: bit to pixel expansion bits were reversed bit order, 32bpp phrasemode
            blits were using wrong address mask, moved srcshade inside transparency check, fixed
            8-bit phrasemode blit alignment several times, added byte-to-phrase blits
	  Blitter improvements: added blitter A1 inc sign, added blitter Y inc, added 8-bit
			srcshade, additive blits
      (Debugger)
      Track RISC history (some of these need compile switches)
      Append register name comments to disasm output
      Added help menu in debugger because I'm too stupid to remember my own commands
      Tidied up some registers
      Kill OP object option
      (Windows)
      Fixed fullscreen on certain widescreen machines
      Connected OP screen width hook
	  Went up to W4 and fixed most of the additional warnings
	  Reversed left and right sound channels
	  Fixed the remaining bugs with fastcall and switched to it, for a small performance gain
	  Added joystick button configuration
	  (All)
	  Clean up headers, clearly define core/window system interface
