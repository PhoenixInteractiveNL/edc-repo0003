Version 0.43b - 11/11/06
Added support for Piters 16 bit IDE interface. Added Disciple & +D Floppy interface.
Fixed a bug in +2A/+3 paging. Preliminary support for QL emulation (Does nothing
useful at the moment). If EightyOne finds FDC765.DLL available, it uses that
instead of lib765 (more compatible for protected +3 disks).
