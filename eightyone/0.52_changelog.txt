Version 0.52 24/8/07
Added ZX81 Larken disk support. Preliminary support for ZX1541 (Only memory and IEC
interface coded, still have to emulate the 1541 itself). Fixed a bug which caused
the emulator to crash if the workstation was locked/suspended/hibernated.  This
may (but only may!) help with Vista compatability.
