Changes - 8th August 2016
-------------------------

byuu says (in the public announcement):

Not a large changelog this time, sorry. This release is mostly to fix
the SA-1 issue, and to get some real-world testing of the new scheduler
model. Most of the work in the past month has gone into writing a 68000
CPU core; yet it's still only about half-way finished.

Changelog (since the previous release):

  - fixed SNES SA-1 IRQ regression (fixes Super Mario RPG level-up
    screen)
  - new scheduler for all emulator cores (precision of 2^-127)
  - icarus database adds nine new SNES games
  - added Input/Frequency to settings file (allows simulation of
    latency)

byuu says (in the WIP forum):

Changelog:

  - in 32-bit mode, Thread uses uint64\_t with 2^-63 time units (10^-7
    precision in the worst case)
      - nearly ten times the precision of an attosecond
  - in 64-bit mode, Thread uses uint128\_t with 2^-127 time units
    (10^-26 precision in the worst case)
      - far more accurate than yoctoseconds; almost closing in on planck
        time

Note: a quartz crystal is accurate to 10^-4 or 10^-5. A cesium fountain
atomic clock is accurate to 10^-15. So ... yeah. 2^-63 was perfectly
fine; but there was no speed penalty whatsoever for using uint128\_t in
64-bit mode, so why not?
