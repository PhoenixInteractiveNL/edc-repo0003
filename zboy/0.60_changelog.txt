zBoy v0.60 [30 Apr 2015]
 - Migrated from SDL to SDL2,
 - Created a DOS port using the Allegro library (the port comes with its own setup utility),
 - Dropped the '--noscreensaver' parameter (always enabled now), and replaced the custom screen-saver inhibitor by SDL2's generic routine,
 - zBoy's configuration changes are persistent now,
 - Added a custom colorization feature (--custcolor), so players can colorize games themselves,
 - Fullscreen can be switched in-game on the SDL2 backend (ALT+ENTER),
 - Added colorization support for Pipe Dream,
 - Removed the '--bootlogo' option,
 - Added '--resetcfg' to reset the configuration to default values,
 - Hi-score persistent memory (--hiscores) is enabled by default,
 - PCX screenshots are saved with a 4bpp depth (results in 50% smaller screenshot files),
 - Renamed the '--colorization' option to a shorter '--colorize',
 - Renamed '--hiscoresmem' to '--hiscores' and added '--nohiscores',
 - Renamed '--nospeedlimit' to '--fullspeed' and added '--nofullspeed',
