Changes - 26th July 2014
------------------------

v1.33 <- v1.32
 * Joystick hat is now handled correctly.
 * Added bindings to switch between previous/next save slots.
 * Fixed joystick calibration issues.
 * Fixed ROM corruption when using Musashi. ROM was not actually read-only.
 * Fixed support for overlapping save RAM and ROM areas.
 * When only Musashi is compiled-in, ROM is not byteswapped anymore to
   improve performance.
 * Disabled automatic ROM checksum fix as it prevents a few ROMs from
   working correctly. Can still be done manually.
 * Debugger: fixed Musashi disassembler to avoid truncating values read
   from memory.
 * Debugger: removed dependency on Musashi. Debugger support can now be
   enabled without it, but it won't be able to disassemble M68K code when
   doing so.
 * Debugger: M68K debugging is now supported by all M68K cores (Musashi,
   StarScream and Cyclone).
 * Debugger: fixed Z80 endianness issue when displaying registers.
 * Improved Z80 BUSREQ/RESET IO read emulation to fix a few games that rely on
   prefetched PC data when reading these addresses.
 * Implemented word (16 bit) memory callbacks for CZ80 to improve performance.
 * Debugger: integrated dZ80, a Z80 disassembler.
 * Fixed interrupt mode 0 in CZ80, fixes sound issues in a few games.
 * Debugger: added full Z80 debugging support. It is supported by all Z80
   cores (MZ80, CZ80 and DrZ80).
 * Fixed CPU dump/restore routines which caused games to crash when switching
   between CPU emulators.
 * Fixed DrZ80 documentation about its Z80 state structure. Modified DGen
   accordingly to solve dump/restore issues.
 * Replaced bool_opengl_aspect with bool_aspect, which also forces scaling
   by the same amount in both directions.
 * Merged scaling and pre/postscale filters APIs. Crap TV filters and scalers
   (scale2x, hqx) now use a similar API. Makes things a lot simpler.
 * Added "stretch" filter to replace the basic scaler. As its name suggests,
   this filter can stretch the picture to fit the window size and is as fast
   as its predecessor. Useful when OpenGL cannot be used.
 * Since filters can be stacked, added two combinations: scale2x + stretch and
   hqx + stretch. Obviously slower than scale2x or hqx alone, but allows
   picture to fit the entire window while looking nicer than simply
   stretching it.
 * Refactored screen initialization, window size is now completely free and
   never modified by DGen/SDL (except during init).
 * Disabled save/restore when no ROM is loaded.
 * Added config_save and config_load commands.
 * Calibration screen is not a CTV filter anymore and is always available.
 * Added preliminary support for Sega Pico.
 * Added VGM dumping functionality (vgmdump command).
 * Fixed DAC data type for Cyclone (distorted sound due to improper type
   conversion).
 * Improved DAC rendering for much better sound quality (try Tiido's Tempo
   Theme ROM). The default sound rate is now 44100Hz instead of 22050Hz.
 * Added missing YM2612 and DAC information to save states.
 * Fixed pbm2df issues on Windows by open files in text mode.
 * Fixed bind_* commands to run only once.
 * Added support for key/joystick button combinations bindings. In short,
   pressing several buttons simultaneously to execute a command (such as
   quitting DGen/SDL) is now supported. See documentation.
 * Merged stopped and main events loops to remove some redundancy.
 * Added standard bindings for Pico pen.
 * Added mouse input support. Mouse buttons and axes can be bound like any
   other controller (also added mou_* variables similar to joy_* and key_*).
 * Fixed sound (re)initialization which sometimes caused sound to stop after
   loading a ROM.
 * Added various workarounds for fbcon (Linux's framebuffer). A common issue
   is screen blinking due to double buffering, now disabled by default.
   Inability to run as a normal user due to missing mouse input and hanging
   during SDL_SetVideoMode() are also worked around.
 * Usual bunch of miscellaneous bugfixes and improvements (libarchive API
   update, many compilation warnings and other issues introduced by recent
   changes).
