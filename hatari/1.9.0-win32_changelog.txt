Changes - 10th October 2015
---------------------------

Version 1.9.0:
---------------------------

Emulation:
- STE Joypads:
  - Fix: Joypad A Option button
  - Fix: Joypad B extended buttons
- ACSI / IDE:
  - Fix: image file attribute check when using device files
  - Fix: v1.8 ACSI regression with A1=0 case
- GEMDOS HD:
  - Fix: matching exactly 8 chars long file names containing '.'
  - Better mapping of host errors to GEMDOS error codes
  - Support for mapping file names with 8-bit characters
    between host and Atari encodings (umlauted chars etc)
  - Program header (TT-RAM) allocate flags support
- CPU:
  - update WinUAE CPU core version from 2.3 -> 2.8.1 -> 3.0 -> 3.1
    - MMU emulation fixed
    - instruction/data cache emulation
    - better 68020/30 prefetch pipeline
    - cycle accuracy, etc.
  - in 68000 mode, remove some un-allowed <ea> for CMPI, BTST and TST
  - check for address error when new PC is set at the end of RTE, RTS and RTR
  - fix "move.b an,<ea>", it's not allowed and should give illegal instruction
  - improve stack frame for bus error and address error
  - allow bus control only for 030
    (i.e. prevent TOS forcing 16Mhz at boot with higher CPU levels)
- Memory:
  - TT-RAM / 32-bit addressing support both for TT & Falcon emulation
    (when using EmuTOS, this requires version 0.9.4 or later)
- FDC changes:
  - for STX disks, fix type I commands with verify bit on tracks with no sector
  - for ST/MSA, check read address and read track are not beyond max track
- MFP:
  - better emulation of GPIP, AER and DDR
- MIDI:
  - some RX/TX interrupt conditions were not correctly handled
  - TDRE bit is status register more accurately handled
- Video:
  - fix value when reading video counter $FF8205/07/09 in high res
- Blitter:
  - when transfer ends, hog bit should be cleared in control register
- DSP:
  - better emulation of the HREQ signal

Emulator:
- Support for compiling with libSDL2 (experimental)
  - SDL2 supports other than 2x scaling factors for ST/e emulation
- Misc fixes:
  - Fix: WinUAE CPU core (FPU) memory state restore
  - Fix: crash with VDI extended resolution emulation when
         C: isn't GEMDOS HD emulated drive
  - Fix: invalid defaults for real joysticks
  - Fix: compilation when zlib is missing
  - Fix: bugs from Debian bug tracker:
	 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=716536
	 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=716084
	 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=688594
- Additional TOS run-time patching:
  - Support fast boot also with TOS v3 & v4
  - Support 32-bit addressing also with TOS v4
  - Replace TOS v4 instructions unsupported on 060
  - HW specific phystop value in VDI mode
- Options:
  - Fast boot (warm boot / memory check bypass) is disabled by default
  - 68060 CPU level and --ttram support with new WinUAE CPU core
  - New --png-level option to decrease AVI compression CPU load
  - Mouse warping on reset & resolution change can be controlled
    with new --mousewarp option
- Hard drive emulation:
  - BUS ID for ACSI drive can be specified with --acsi
  - GUI and command line options to enable 8-bit file name
    Atari <-> host charset conversion for GEMDOS HD
  - GUI and command line options to specify GEMDOS HD emulation drive
    (default = C:), or to skip recognized drives used by partitions
    on ACSI & IDE images
    - Partition count parsed by Hatari might not match count used by
      Atari HD driver due to driver differences in interpreting disk MBR
  - Refuse to mount same HD image from multiple Hatari instances
    (on platforms supporting BSD flock()), to avoid corrupting them
- SDL GUI:
  - joystick navigation in options GUI
  - keyboard navigation & shortcuts in options GUI
  - sort file selector items case-insensitively with folders first
  - Partial support for showing Latin1 chars from UTF-8 file names
  - AltGr+F<1-4> keyboard shortcuts to switch mode/type for emulated
    joysticks and joypads
  - User can reset or quit emulation from CPU halt dialog
  - Fix: sync joystick changes with statusbar
  - Fix: update default max window size for 2-line statusbar
         NOTE: size would need to be updated in Hatari config files too!
  - Fix: statusbar assert when FPU/MMU/TT-RAM are enabled in WinUAE CPU core
  - When cpu enters 'halt' state in case of double bus/address errors,
    show a dialog window to reset or call the debugger
  - Fix bug in the filesector dialog that could create bug in other
    dialogs used in Hatari
- Debugger:
  - Fix: crash when GEMDOS tracing is used without GEMDOS HD emulation
  - Fix: update external disassembler's CPU mask when CPU type is changed
         (it wasn't restricted to opcodes valid for given CPU type)
  - Fix: breakpoint addition/removal within chained breakpoints
  - Fix: Atari program detection on Windows for "symbols" command
  - Profiler support for TT-RAM (uses *ton* of memory)
  - Profiler support for (030) data cache and new "profile caches"
    command to show i/d-cache hit/miss histograms
  - Add trace support for IDE, MIDI and keymaps.  ACSI (SCSI) and IDE
    trace output shows primary partition tables for ACSI & IDE images
    (both Atari and DOS MBRs are supported)
  - Add "os_base" trace option to trace Fopen/Fclose/Pexec/Pterm*.
    That and "os_all" will now enable also xconout console redirection
  - Output from --conout goes now to stdout instead of stderr
  - Add "reset <hard|soft>" command
  - Add "save" subcommand to "history" command
  - Add "basepage" address variable

Other changes:
- Add script to convert long host file names to Atari file names,
  use that in atari-hd-image script
- Add hatari-prg-args script for providing arguments to autostarted programs
- Fix Atari program detection on Windows in "gst2ascii" tool
- Hatari & disk image icons in SVG & PNG formats (multiple sizes)
- Remaining Hatari OSX UI changes for Hatari v1.8.0 (localization)
- Add video-recording.txt doc on video recording/uploading best practices

Fixed demos:
- Graphix Sound 2 in Relapse by Cybernetics (blitter+cpu, bus arbitration)
- RGBeast by Aggression (video, writing to video counter during active display)
- My Socks Are Weapons by Legacy (video, reading video counter in high res)

Fixed games:
- Superior 65 - Blood Money (cpu, exception stack and bus error)
  (note that this version is bugged and will crash with TOS 1.04 or 1.62)
- Obitus (STX version) (fdc, seek+verify on a track with no sector)
- The Teller (STX/CTR version) (cpu, exception stack and address error)
- War Heli (cpu, exception stack for address error and prefetch)

Fixed programs:
- Realtime and M by Eric Ameres (midi + mfp, toggle bit 0 of AER)
- Notator (midi, more precise TDRE bit in status register)
- Cubase 2 (midi, reported by user)

Known regressions (see compatibility list):
- Suretrip demo by Checkpoint
- Golden Island game demo with WinUAE CPU core
- TT-version of 4getful demo with WinUAE CPU core
